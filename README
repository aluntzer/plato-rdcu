tl;dr If you don't know what this is, you probably don't want to.


ABOUT

This is a library and demonstrator for the current version of hardware
compression and the software compression for the PLATO ASW.

The FPGA-based SpaceWire Router and Data Compressor Unit (RDCU) was built in
collaboration with the University of Vienna, Department of Astrophysics (IFA/UVIE)
and the Austrian Academy of Sciences Space Research Institute (IWF/OEAW) for
PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars).

The RDCU consists of a GR718RB SpaceWire router and an RTAX2000 FPGA
holding the RMAP Target and Data Compressor. All of these components are
utilised in the demonstrator.



ATTENTION

This is not production-ready code, mostly because I cannot tell what
your operating system environment will be and how you will actually command
the RMAP targets or handle RMAP timeouts etc.


HOWTO

RTFM (see doxygen tags in source and source itself), otherwise:

1) run make
2) start grmon
3) ???
4) profit!
