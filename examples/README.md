PLATO Compression Library Files : usage examples
================================================

- [demo\_plato\_rdcu](demo_plato_rdcu.c) :
  This is a demonstrator showing the main features of the PLATO Compression
  Library for the __GR712RC__ development board.  
   __ATTENTION:__
   This is not production-ready code, mostly because I can't tell what
   your operating system environment will be and how you will actually command
   the RMAP targets or handle RMAP timeouts etc.
