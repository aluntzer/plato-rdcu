 * @defgroup linked_list Linked Lists
 * @brief a modified doubly-linked list implementation from the linux kernel
 *
 *
 * This is a (slightly modified) doubly-linked list implementation from the
 * Linux kernel. An easy to understand explanation of
 * how it works and is used can be found here
 * http://kernelnewbies.org/FAQ/LinkedLists
 *
 * Be smart
 * -----
 * It is a valid to criticise linked lists as generally performing badly
 * if you traverse their entries at high frequency rather than just
 * manipulating them. This can be especially true (and has been demonstrated
 * numerous times) for implementations like std:list.
 *
 * Please consider the following though: linked lists are not inherently
 * slow because of how they work algorithmically (*the opposite is true*),
 * but rather because how their cache hit (or miss) rate is in
 * configurations where entries are randomly scattered in memory rather
 * than laid out in one big chunk.
 *
 * Be smart. Don't do that. Allocate a pool in a __single chunk__ and enjoy the
 * cache performance. Do not use larger chunks than the page size of your
 * platform if you have MMU support. If you need more than that, you probably
 * need to redesign your program anyways.
 *
 * This does of course not apply as long as you do access your lists only
 * at slow rates (i.e. in the order of several tens of ms) or if performance
 * is not at all critial.
